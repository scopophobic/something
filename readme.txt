2D Cloth Simulation

Started off trying to make a basic cloth simulation from scratch (no external libraries).
At this point, I have no idea what I just made — but it looks cool and it was fun clicking stuff :)

What it does:
- Simulates cloth using a grid of connected points (weirdly behaving cloth)
- You can:
  • Drag the mouse to attract points
  • Swipe to cut the cloth
  • Press SPACE to throw balls at it
  • Use Arrow Up/Down to play with Z-depth (makes stuff look kinda 3D)

No frameworks, no physics engines — just pure JS and canvas.

That’s it!
